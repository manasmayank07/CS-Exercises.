## ðŸ“Œ Exercises Implemented

### âœ… 2.1.10 â€“ `lg()`
A static method that computes the floor of the base-2 logarithm of a given integer `n` **without using `Math` library**.  
- ðŸ“‚ File: `LgMethod.java`  
- ðŸ“š Concepts: Loops, integer division.

---

### âœ… 2.1.19 â€“ `histogram()`
A static method that counts how many times each integer `i` appears in an array `a[]` for `i` in `[0, m-1]`.  
- ðŸ“‚ File: `HistogramMethod.java`  
- ðŸ“š Concepts: Arrays, frequency counting.

### âœ… 2.1.29 â€“ Fourier Spikes
A program that plots or outputs the sum of cosine waves:
\[
f(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \cos(k t)
\]
for `t` in [-10, 10]. Demonstrates how adding sinusoids converges to a spike function.  
- ðŸ“‚ File: `FourierSpikes.java`  
- ðŸ“š Concepts: Fourier series, loops, output for plotting.

---

### âœ… 2.2.26 â€“ Poker Analysis
A simulation program that estimates the probabilities of various poker hands (pair, flush, etc.) using random sampling.  
- ðŸ“‚ File: `PokerAnalysis.java`  
- ðŸ“š Concepts: Randomization, arrays, simulations, probability.
